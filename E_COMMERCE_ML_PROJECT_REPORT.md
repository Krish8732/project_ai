## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement

E-commerce platforms face the critical challenge of understanding customer purchase intent to optimize conversion rates and revenue. Traditional approaches rely on basic analytics and rule-based systems, which often fail to capture complex customer behavior patterns and provide actionable insights for business optimization.

### 1.2 Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
- Develop a high-accuracy machine learning model for purchase prediction
- Implement real-time prediction capabilities with sub-100ms latency
- Create an interpretable system that provides business insights
- Design a scalable, production-ready architecture
- Establish A/B testing framework for continuous improvement

### 1.3 Scope

This project focuses on predicting purchase probability for individual product views in an e-commerce environment, utilizing session data, product information, and temporal features to make real-time predictions.

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 E-commerce Machine Learning Applications

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning in e-commerce applications. Chen et al. (2020) showed that ensemble methods can improve prediction accuracy by 15-20% compared to single models. The work by Zhang et al. (2021) highlighted the importance of feature engineering in e-commerce prediction tasks.

### 2.2 Ensemble Learning in E-commerce

Ensemble learning has proven particularly effective in e-commerce applications. The combination of gradient boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) with traditional algorithms has shown consistent performance improvements (Liu et al., 2022).

### 2.3 Real-time Prediction Systems

The implementation of real-time prediction systems requires careful consideration of latency and throughput requirements. Recent work by Kumar et al. (2023) demonstrated that caching strategies can reduce prediction latency by up to 90% while maintaining accuracy.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Data Collection and Preprocessing

The dataset consists of 1.05 million e-commerce events collected over 7 months (October 2019 - April 2020). The data includes:

- **User Information**: User ID, session ID, temporal features
- **Product Information**: Product ID, category, brand, price
- **Behavioral Data**: Event types, session duration, interaction patterns

### 3.2 Feature Engineering

Advanced feature engineering was implemented to capture customer behavior patterns:

#### 3.2.1 Session-Level Features
- Total events per session
- Unique products viewed
- Session duration
- Average price viewed
- Conversion rate

#### 3.2.2 User-Level Features
- Historical purchase behavior
- Average session duration
- Product category preferences
- Time-based patterns

#### 3.2.3 Temporal Features
- Hour of day
- Day of week
- Weekend indicator
- Seasonal patterns

### 3.3 Model Architecture

The system employs an ensemble approach combining four machine learning algorithms:

#### 3.3.1 Individual Models
1. **CatBoost**: Gradient boosting with categorical feature handling
2. **XGBoost**: Extreme gradient boosting with regularization
3. **LightGBM**: Light gradient boosting machine
4. **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees

#### 3.3.2 Ensemble Strategy
The final prediction combines individual model outputs using weighted voting:

```
P(purchase) = 0.4 × P_catboost + 0.3 × P_xgboost + 0.2 × P_lightgbm + 0.1 × P_rf
```

### 3.4 Hyperparameter Optimization

Automated hyperparameter optimization using Optuna framework:

```python
def objective(trial):
    params = {
        'iterations': trial.suggest_int('iterations', 100, 1000),
        'learning_rate': trial.suggest_float('learning_rate', 0.01, 0.3),
        'depth': trial.suggest_int('depth', 4, 10),
        'l2_leaf_reg': trial.suggest_float('l2_leaf_reg', 1, 10)
    }
    return roc_auc_score(y_val, model.predict_proba(X_val)[:, 1])
```

    chunk_size = 10000
    processed_chunks = []
    
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=chunk_size):
        # Sample data to reduce memory usage
        sampled_chunk = chunk.sample(frac=sample_rate)
        processed_chunk = feature_engineering(sampled_chunk)
        processed_chunks.append(processed_chunk)

async def predict_purchase(user_data: UserData):
    start_time = time.time()
    
    # Feature generation
    features = generate_features(user_data)
    
    # Model prediction
    probability = ensemble_model.predict_proba(features)[:, 1][0]
    
    # Business insights
    insights = generate_business_insights(probability, user_data)
    
    # Response time tracking
    latency = time.time() - start_time
    
    return PredictionResponse(
        probability=probability,
        insights=insights,
