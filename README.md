Project AI – E-Commerce ML System
📌 Overview
This project implements an end-to-end machine learning system for e-commerce, covering the full lifecycle of model development:

Data preparation & training

CatBoost model deployment (single-model API)

Real-time inference

Model monitoring

Documentation & reports

The system is modular, scalable, and production-ready, with emphasis on reliable baseline CatBoost ML deployment and robust monitoring.

🚀 Features
Model Training – CatBoost-based training pipeline
(ecommerce_ml_training.py, run_mm_train.py)

Deployment – Scripts for exporting & serving models
(deploy_model.py, deployed_model.pkl)

API – Simple REST API for predictions
(api_example.py)

Model Monitoring – Automated monitoring tools
(model_monitoring.py, logs in prep_log.txt)

Testing Suite – Unit/integration testing
(test_deployed_model.py)

Documentation – Reports and flowcharts for workflows and system design

⚙️ Setup & Installation
Clone the repository

bash
git clone https://github.com/Krish8732/project_ai.git
cd project_ai
Install dependencies

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Verify installation

bash
python -m unittest discover
🏋️ Training the Model
To train from scratch:

bash
python ecommerce_ml_training.py
Or using automated runner:

bash
python run_mm_prep.py
python run_mm_train.py
Artifacts saved as .pkl files.

🌐 Deploying the Model
Start API server:

bash
python api_example.py
Test with:

bash
python test_deployed_model.py
📊 Monitoring
Run monitoring tools:

bash
python model_monitoring.py
Logs saved in prep_log.txt.
